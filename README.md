# Functional Testing Tutorial - Setup Instructions

Welcome! This tutorial uses Python to explore **functional testing** in scientific code. The 
tutorial notebooks rely on a small library containing fire code examples (`fire_equations.py`,
`fuel_class.py`, etc.). This code is translated from the SPITFIRE module within the 
[FATES](https://github.com/NGEET/fates) repository.

Follow these steps to set up your environment and install the library.

## 1. Clone the repository

Open a terminal and run:
