    "We often work with large code bases, and ensuring that each individual piece is working is difficult. By isolating individual parts of the code base, while still *utilizing* the codebase, we can exercise and test parts of the code, knowing that we are testing the actual production code.\n",

This code has been translated from the Fortran \"SPITFIRE\" code in the [FATES](https://github.com/NGEET/fates) repository for ease of use in this tutorial. However, the concepts here are directly applicable to the original code base (or other large Fortran codebases)."
